Overview of the Social Issue 

Small-scale businesses or the so called Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (mostly referred to as “MSMEs”)  has became a resurgence of interest over the Philippine trading industry. It contributes a significant impact over the economy in pursuing economic development. MSMEs employ 70 percent of the country’s total workforce that make up 99.6 percent of the country’s registered business establishments (Department of Trade and Industry, 2016). 
In an Editorial in Manila Times (2016), MSMEs are the most vulnerable in the ASEAN Integration movement with the non-tariff barriers removed, which make markets more open and more competitive. MSMEs should be given more access on government resources and those coming from other financial institutions to be able to improve their products and operations-and themselves more able to compete against the stronger ASEAN rivals. They are encouraged to adapt best practices and benchmarking in the productivity of their products and services. 
With the implementation of ASEAN Integration, marketing your products in traditional way would become less effective and more expensive with a higher probability to cease trading.  This is however, a win-lose situation to all MSMEs in welcoming the said free economic trading of ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). Philippine MSMEs who are expanding their horizons should invest well  in understanding the documentary procedures for taking advantages of trading concessions. 
The leverage of the Internet over the business sectors has been totally emerging. This is the reason large companies and conglomerates have decided to shift their cultures and understand the capacity of Information Technology.  Business Integration synchronizes IT and align business strategy and goals to absorb IT as a firm function. 
Most transformation of businesses to coordinate new technologies requires different stages of collaboration and strategic discussions. The effectiveness of this innovative ideas has resulted to a most robust and virtually successful businesses in local, national and international.

Overview of the information System Solution 

Organizations of 21st Century centers their operations with the use of Information System(s) to manage services; sell products; generate business strategy; and mainly to survive the demand of the market. Innovation is a must in every business organization today, as it serves as an ingredient of success. 
MamaDeria is a mobile app that caters the need of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises to engage with the competition of marketable products and services.  This will help our SMEs fathom the problem with ASEAN Integration as the most vulnerable factor in our country’s adoption of AEC. This will help draw the attention of the consumers and design a business strategy to address the limitations that could occur during the operation of the business. The researchers will add the UP-ISSI model (University of the Philippines - Institute for Small-Scale Industries) that will assist in the creation of business plans, and selling techniques in most effective and creative way. 

Review of Related Literature

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
It is a long established fact that a reader will be
distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
