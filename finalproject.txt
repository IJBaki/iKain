Introduction 

Small-scale businesses or the so called Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (mostly referred to as “MSMEs”) has became a resurgence of interest over the Philippine trading industry. It contributes a significant impact over the economy in pursuing economic development. MSMEs employ 70 percent of the country’s total workforce that make up 99.6 percent of the country’s registered business establishments (Department of Trade and Industry, 2016). 

In an Editorial in Manila Times (2016), MSMEs are the most vulnerable in the ASEAN Integration movement with the non-tariff barriers removed, which make markets more open and more competitive. MSMEs should be given more access on government resources and those coming from other financial institutions to be able to improve their products and operations-and themselves more able to compete against the stronger ASEAN rivals. They are encouraged to adapt best practices and benchmarking in the productivity of their products and services. 
With the implementation of ASEAN Integration, marketing your products in traditional way would become less effective and more expensive with a higher probability to cease trading.  This is however, a win-lose situation to all MSMEs in welcoming the said free economic trading of ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). Philippine MSMEs who are expanding their horizons should invest well  in understanding the documentary procedures for taking advantages of trading concessions.

The leverage of the Internet over the business sectors has been totally emerging. This is the reason large companies and conglomerates have decided to shift their cultures and understand the capacity of Information Technology.  Business Integration synchronizes IT and align business strategy and goals to absorb IT as a firm function. 

Most transformation of businesses to coordinate new technologies requires different stages of collaboration and strategic discussions. The effectiveness of this innovative ideas has resulted to a most robust and virtually successful businesses in local, national and international.
